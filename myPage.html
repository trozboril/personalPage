				<h3>Bio...</h3>
				<p>I was born in Naperville, IL which is a suburb of chicago. I enjoyed hanging out with friends, playing sports, and submersing myself in video game environments.<br><br>I played water polo, and swam for my highschool. I wasn't amazing at either. I was not a popular guy, but wasn't an outcast. It was more like I flew under the radar most of my higschool years.<br><br>I went to college and started acting like a person I was not. Luckily, I was smart enough to not continue down that road, and joined the USAF. I got honorably discharged, and started going to school for computer engineering. My wife got pregnant and now I find myself in Denver going to Galvanize for web development.</p>

					<p>Sushi: <br>I will devour any make of sushi that exists. My "ichi ban" style is nigiri. It's a piece of sticky rice, made with sugar and rice vinigar, packed into a small ball. It then has fresh, raw fish of various types placed ontop of it. Often accompanied by a tiny dollop of wassabi underneath.</p>

					<p>Crab: <br>I love crab, the spiders of the sea! I will eat any type that is prepared well. My favorite kind is king crab which is pictured to the left. It's harder to get at, but worth it!</p>

					<p>Game: <br>Counter Strike: Global Offensive is my favorite video game (atleast it was when I still played video games around summer of 2015.) I enjoy the competative aspect of gameplay, as well as the slight adrenaline rush a first person shooter gives. This game has an awesome ranking system.</p>
